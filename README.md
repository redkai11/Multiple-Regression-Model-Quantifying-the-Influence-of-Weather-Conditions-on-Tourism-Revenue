# Multiple-Regression-Model-Quantifying-the-Influence-of-Weather-Conditions-on-Tourism-Revenue

# Description
* Data collecting and cleansing
* Multiregression analysis and model selection
* Interpreting the final multiregression model and drawing insights

This is a group project I collaborated with 3 other peers in my STAT306 course.
The final report was written in RMarkdown.
I wrote the R code alone, and my peers and I collaborated on writing the final report.
I will not be sharing the R code and datasets as I do not wish this work to be modified or reproduced in any way.  

P.S. I blurred out the names and student number for privacy reasons. Also, I know the citation order is incorrect but I didn't bother to fix it since it wasn't for marks :D
